### Overview

This document will help you build BDRE from source. Audience for this document are developers and architects who want be part of BDRE framework development or may just want to test it by running the UI. Please read [this document](https://gitlab.com/bdre/documentation/wikis/list-of-things-to-learn-for-BDRE-framework-development) and understand the skillset needed (or to be learned) for contributing to BDRE.

### Setup

* Install Git, MVN and Oracle JDK 7(and up) if you haven't already. In Windows be sure to add git and other bash tools in the commandline path during installation. To get started download and install following free, safe and open source software.

 - Oracle JDK 7 
 - Git Command line Client (For Windows - GitBash)[Download for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
 - Maven [Download for Windows](http://apache.mirrors.pair.com/maven/maven-3/3.3.3/binaries/apache-maven-3.3.3-bin.zip)
 - IntelliJ Idea (download Community edition)[Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
 - MySQL 5.6 [Download for Windows](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bdre-public/software/mysql-installer-community-5.6.25.0.msi)


For complete software requirement read [this](https://gitlab.com/bdre/documentation/wikis/software-requirement-for-bdre-development). You don't need to download all software to run the UI in the browser. Git, Maven, MySQL and Intellij should be enough.

**Important:**

After installing Git first set your full name (like John Doe) and email id in git config using following command.

`git config --global user.name "Your Name"`

`git config --global user.email "your_email@company.com"`

Replace *Your Name* and *your_email* with your real name and your real email.
* Add `jdk` location in the PATH env variable.
* Add `JAVA_HOME` env variable with your installed jdk location.
* Add `mvn` location in the PATH env variable.
* Add `M2_HOME` env variable with your installed maven location.
* To use git from Command line, add `git` location in the PATH env variable.
* To use mysql from Command Line, add `mysql` location in the PATH env variable.

### Proxy setup while working behind a proxy network

- If you are behind proxy then you need to setup proxy for command line operations. The easiest way to do that would be adding 3 environment variables before performing any git operations. If you want to set proxy permanently then [read this](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/sysdm_advancd_environmnt_addchange_variable.mspx?mfr=true).


```shell
In Linux use this:
export http_proxy=http://<proxy username>:<proxy password>@<your proxy server>:<proxy port>
export https_proxy=http://<proxy username>:<proxy password>@<your proxy server>:<proxy port>
export no_proxy=localhost

```
Replace `export` with `set` if you are working in Windows.

**Git Proxy Setting:** Git sometimes needs separate proxy configuration to connect to repositories.

For e.g. to set proxy:

`git config --global https.proxy https://<proxy username>:<proxy password>@<your proxy server>:<proxy port>`

`git config --global http.proxy http://<proxy username>:<proxy password>@<your proxy server>:<proxy port>`

Note: If your proxy uses Active Directory authentication then you need to add `DOMAIN\` before the username

To reset configured proxy use this:

`git config --global --unset https.proxy`

`git config --global --unset http.proxy`



### Test your git access:

You may skip this section if you are familiar with Git version control or in hurry :-).

Please clone the following **test repo** in Gitlab and create your branch , make and push your change and test anything you want. You need to create a ssh key to make changes. Contact @bdremishi, @bdrearijit, @bdreharsha, @bdrekapil if you face any issues.

Test this: `git clone https://<yourid>@gitlab.com/bdre/test.git`.
Where *yourid* is your gitlab user id (like bdrejohn).

If you are not familiar with Git version control, please read the following Git tutorials.

BDRE quick git head start - [bdre_getting_started.pptx](https://gitlab.com/bdre/documentation/uploads/af02e6fef5ef1137429561877703fcb4/bdre_getting_started.pptx)

[Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/) (note we are not using Atlassian git but git command line tutorial is same for all git providers)

[Watch Git Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p0hrpNaJ14)

Once you are able to access git and became familiar, please checkout three BDRE repositories.

### `bdre-app` Repository

`git clone https://<yourid>gitlab.com/bdre/bdre-app.git`

You can proceed to 'Building' section if you just want to run the UI. You do not need to clone or build the Jack repo to run the UI.


### Jack Repository:

`git clone https://<yourid>@gitlab.com/bdre/jack.git`



**Important:** Dealing with line endings

Linux and Windows differ in how they handle line endings.

The `git config core.autocrlf` command is used to change how Git handles line endings. It takes a single argument. So it is better to set the `autocrlf` in git accordingly to avoid further complications.

* In Windows use: `git config --global core.autocrlf true`.
* In Linux use: `git config --global core.autocrlf input`.

For further changes to convert CRLF to LF when you are using linux systems refer to this link (https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/)

## Building

* Open your settings.xml. Itâ€™s in **~/.m2/settings.xml**. If not present please create it. Alternatively you can right click any .pom in IntelliJ Idea and open/create **settings.xml**.

* Obtain the [settings.xml](https://gitlab.com/bdre/jack/raw/develop/installer/guestfiles/maven/settings.xml) from Jack/installer/guestfiles/maven/ and replace your local **~/.m2/settings.xml**.

* NOTE : Add or change the jar versions in settings.xml according to your need but pasting [settings.xml](https://gitlab.com/bdre/jack/raw/develop/installer/guestfiles/maven/settings.xml) AS IS should be fine.
*If you have proxied internet access then [configure proxy](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html)

Behind proxied networks, placing following in settings.xml should work.

```xml
<proxies>
        <proxy>
            <id>your-proxy</id>
            <active>true</active>
            <protocol>http</protocol>
            <username>yourUserName</username>
            <password>yourPassword</password>
            <host>proxyHost</host>
            <port>proxyPort</port>
            <nonProxyHosts>localhost</nonProxyHosts>
        </proxy>
</proxies>
```
* Perform a mvn clean install in bdre-app project only. By default BDRE comes with H2 database which works on single node clusters. But when using bigger (more node) systems, a production scale database is required. BDRE currently supports 3 more databases:
    - H2: The DDL's are located at *bdre-app/databases/h2/ddls*.
    - Oracle: The DDL's are located at *bdre-app/databases/oracle/ddls*.
    - PostgreSQL: The DDL's are located at *bdre-app/databases/postgresql/ddls*.
    - MySQL: The DDL's are located at *bdre-app/databases/mysql/ddls*.
* When maven build is done it by default copies the *db.properties* present in *bdre-app/databases* folder into the *md-dao/src/main/resources*. You will need to modify the *db.properties* present in *md-dao/src/main/resources* for the appropriate DB selected. But if you want to modify the DB before building, then you need to copy that *db.properties* manually and put inside *md-dao/src/main/resources* and modify it according to your needs. *  **Note:** Do not modify the db.properties present inside the databases folder  *
* `create-tables.sql` and `drop-tables.sql` are located inside each ddls folder corresponding to the DB. According to the DB that you are using run appropriate ddls in your Database GUI. In the next step an example is shown for MySQL.

* Using MySQL, the steps to be performed are as shown:
    - Start MySQL 5.6 server and create *platmd* DB and MySQL credentials

      `mysql -u root -e "create database platmd;"`

      `mysqladmin -u root password 'root'`

    - create the tables and procs using bdre-app/databases/mysql/ddls `drop-tables.sql` and`create-tables.sql` inside the various DB folders. Copy the commands and run in your specific DataBase GUI, in this case in MySQL Workbench.
  

* Two additional jars are required for *flume-source* and JSON *SerDe*. For this to be done, download the zip from [here](https://github.com/cloudera/cdh-twitter-example.git) as these jars are still not available in the maven repository, they need to be custom built. 
    - Goto *flume-sources* inside the folder and do `mvn clean install`.
    - Goto *hive-serdes* inside the folder and do `mvn clean install`.
    - From inside the flume-sources/target folder copy the `flume-sources-1.0-SNAPSHOT` jar to bdre-app/target/lib.
    - From inside the hive-serdes/target folder copy the `hive-serdes-1.0-SNAPSHOT` jar to bdre-app/target/lib.

## Running the BDRE Web UI

* After a successful build of bdre-app project, cd into md-rest-api folder and start the Jetty server using quick-run.bat (or .sh if you are using Unix)(Make sure the Batch Scripts Support for Windows or Bash Support for Unix plugin is installed)
* Use Chrome browser and open http://localhost:9999/mdui/pages/content.page
* Login using admin/zaq1xsw2
* BDRE home page looks like [this](https://gitlab.com/bdre/documentation/uploads/6d1699cdbdb15648ba0b849dd1923367/bdress.png)

## Creating a test job

* Create a RDBMS data import job from *Job Setup From Template > New RDBMS Import Job*
* Change the JDBC URL/credentials to your localhost MySQL platmd DB that contains BDRE metadata.
* Click test connection
* Select 2 - 3 tables with columns like [this](https://gitlab.com/bdre/documentation/uploads/d93c5de43dbf79502226d7227a7b46ae/rdbms_import.png)
* Create the jobs and see the [pipeline](https://gitlab.com/bdre/documentation/uploads/3bce103069908d065beb8d04b15f7cc7/pipeline.png).
* Click *XML* , *Details* etc and checkout the generated workflow.

## Open the projects in IntelliJ Idea

* We strongly recommend using IntelliJ Idea to develop BDRE. However BDRE should work fine with other Java IDEs
* Start Idea and go to **File > Open ...** and then browse to the repo folder and open it.
* Idea will automatically detect the maven projects and prompt to *Import Changes*. Import changes. [Here](https://gitlab.com/bdre/documentation/uploads/5578910e1812ce684dd70b73fe345f0c/BDRE_idea.png) is how the bdre-app project looks while opened in Idea.
* After completion of import, open the terminal window and perform usual git and mvn operations.
  - e.g. mvn clean install
* You *must* now create your own branch in the project when you are ready to contribute to BDRE. * **Note:** Never modify code in develop branch.*
* Please use [git properly](https://gitlab.com/bdre/documentation/uploads/af02e6fef5ef1137429561877703fcb4/bdre_getting_started.pptx) and contribute to the development.
* For completed, committed and pushed changes, open *Merge Request* from gitlab.com.
* Good luck!

## How to Deploy Process in your hadoop environment
After making entries into metadata related to your process, you have to deploy this process in your hadoop environment.
### Steps to deploy your process
1. Click deploy button on process page corresponding to the process you want to deploy. ( Deploy button will show status regarding deployment of process, when you hover over the button.)

2. You have to provide executable permissions to every shell script present in home folder.

3. You have to edit deploy-env.properties. Set all properties based on your environment.

4. Process Deploy main class calls deploy script based on type of container process. For Example for process type 1 it will call process-type-1.sh script.

5. You have to setup a crontab in your environment. Crontab will run process-deploy.sh script present in home folder.
for example `*/5 * * * * /home/cloudera/process-deploy.sh`.

6. After the deployment is complete and in UI the status for the process is deployed (turns green), you have to execute it.

7. Update Workflow.py and flume.sh according to your environment present in home folder.
 Update hostname variable in Workflow.py.
 Update `pathForFlumeng`, `pathForFlumeconf`, `pathForFlumeconfFile` variables in flume.sh.

8. To store logs for execution, you have to create log directory as mentioned in administration -> settings -> mdconfig -> execute.log-path. create directory and give permission for every user to write into it. `chmod -R 777 <folderName>`

9. Also update path in administration -> settings -> mdconfig -> execute.oozie-script-path tags for Workflow.py. And under administration -> settings -> mdconfig -> execute.standalone-script-path for flume.sh.
